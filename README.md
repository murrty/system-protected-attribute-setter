# system-protected-attribute-setter
Sets the attribute "System Protected" to selected files/folders

this was mainly a test to look around the [ookii dialogs](https://github.com/caioproiete/ookii-dialogs-winforms) library, but i was reading on attribute flags and implemented it with the "system protected" attribute flag.
